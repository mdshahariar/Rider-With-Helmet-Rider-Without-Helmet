# Rider-With-Helmet-Rider-Without-Helmet
Overview This repository hosts a custom deep learning pipeline that integrates YOLOv8 and VGG16 models to detect riders wearing helmets and those without helmets. The project aims to enhance safety measures by providing real-time detection capabilities, particularly useful for traffic monitoring and safety enforcement scenarios.
